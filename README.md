In this repo I'm registering my progress on React Native course, to remember and share to someone else who, like me, is getting started and is interested.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Setup Enviroment</h2>
<p align='justify'>
The first step consists to configure the enviroment, for that I followed the <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup">React Native Tutorial</a> to setup React Native CLI on Windows plataform. <br/>
As suggested, I installed the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/install">Chocolatey</a>, that I used to install the OpenJDK, and <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">nvm-windows</a> to install and manage the NodeJS versions.<br/>

Then, to test my applications, I installed the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> and setup a device. I had no idea, but all this work would be for nothing, because the course uses Expo to test the apps. I just started this one after setup my enviroment because I was moving, and would gave no network connection for a few days, and the little bit experience I had with React Native before tath required an emulator to run the applications. But anyway, this enviroment that I created certainly will be useful later on.
  
So, I just started the course...

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p align='justify'>
Initially, the instructor gave me a base project that we will use for something along the course to practice some especifical features. I downloaded, extract on my workspace directory and open that directory on terminal. Next, as instructed by the teacher, I ran the command <code>npm install --legacy-peer-deps</code> to install all project dependecies. And it's occurred all good, nothing errors! After that, I ran <code>npm start</code> to open the React Native bundler which gotten my code ready to be ran on a mobile device. Than I downloaded the Expo Go on App Store and scanned the QR code from RN Bundler and... <i>Voil√†</i>! the app was running on my phone.
